# Cool Mammals: Backbone example code

This is my equivalent to a To Do app. It's just a silly app to help demonstrate Backbone code.

The idea is to re-build this same app in all of the major frameworks, including Angular, React/Redux, and Angular 2.

Here in my Backbone example we can see Routes, Models, Collections, Templates, Forms, Etc.

I have also used Require JS to help modularise the code, and make the application nicely organised and scalable.
